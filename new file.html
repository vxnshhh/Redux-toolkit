        Hacktoberfest is an event hosted by DigitalOcean that partners with many organizations.
        The goal is to give back and contribute to open-source projects. 
        The organizers offer little incentives for a job well done, like a shirt and stickers.
        Other organizations also get involved by offering their own rewards. 
        You can find a community-sourced list of organizations offering incentives to contribute on Hacktoberfest Swag.
        Only meaningful contributions will count toward the total 4 required. 
        Take your time and show common courtesy with maintainers to ensure your pull requests get merged. 
        More on this in Let's Avoid Turning it into Spamtoberfest below.</p>
